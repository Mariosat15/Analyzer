   - Check for data quality issues (missing values, etc.)

3. **Slow AI performance**:
   - Reduce analysis timeframe for faster processing
   - Disable Prophet forecasting for quicker results
   - Use cached results when available

4. **Memory issues with large datasets**:
   - Reduce number of assets in multi-asset dashboard
   - Use shorter time periods for analysis
   - Close other applications to free up RAM
